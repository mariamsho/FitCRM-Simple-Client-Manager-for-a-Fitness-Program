Core Features
This project meets the requirements for a responsive, two-page static application using only HTML and CSS.

1. New Client Form (client-form.html)
A clean form layout using CSS Grid to collect essential client details: Full Name, Age, Gender, Email, Phone, Fitness Goal, and Membership Start Date.

The "Add Client" button is a placeholder and does not currently save or process data.

2. Client List View (client-list.html)
A responsive table displaying 10 sample clients with their Name, Email, Phone, Fitness Goal, and Membership Start Date.

Action buttons (Edit/Delete) are included as functional placeholders.

A search box is provided for fetching clients by name.

3. Responsive Design
The layout utilizes CSS Flexbox and Grid to ensure optimal display on both desktop and mobile devices.

Non-critical table columns (Phone, Goal, Start Date) are hidden on mobile using media queries to maintain readability and enhance the user experience on small screens.
